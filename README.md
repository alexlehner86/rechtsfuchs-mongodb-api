This project represents the server api for my project "[Rechtsfuchs](https://github.com/alexlehner86/rechtsfuchs)". It uses a MongoDB database to store user data as well as the user's projects and documents.


It is based on Jason Watmore's tutorial project [NodeJS + MongoDB API for User Management, Authentication and Registration](http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/06/14/nodejs-mongodb-simple-api-for-authentication-registration-and-user-management).
