This project represents the NodeJS MongoDB API for my project "[Rechtsfuchs](https://github.com/alexlehner86/rechtsfuchs)". It uses a MongoDB database to store user data as well as the user's projects and documents.

If you want to use my code for your own project, you'll have to fill in the information of your MongoDB database in the config.json file. I deleted my own MongoDB credentials and replaced them with place holders. 

This project is based on Jason Watmore's tutorial project [NodeJS + MongoDB API for User Management, Authentication and Registration](http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/06/14/nodejs-mongodb-simple-api-for-authentication-registration-and-user-management).
